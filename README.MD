about code.py:
code.py is the source code of the compiled version (compiled from python file to exe  file) of the auto-ocr project, ocr is Optical character recognition or זיהוי תווים אופטי in hebrew.
you can use the code.py code if you have python installed, if you don't have python then you can use the compiled version of the code (exe file), also the code and the exe file is identical (doing the same thing).

about the mega link:
after you download the file in the mega link you will find rar (similar to zip file, you will need winrar for that)file with passwrod, there is a password because in that way the browser does not block the download (the browser consider the rar file as virus), extract the rar file with winrar and enter the password (1234), then find the executable (exe extension) file and click it.

How to use the program:
click ctrl key and after you here the sound click ctrl key again and the text in the areas between the two clicks will be saved into your clipboard so can hit ctrl + v and you there you go! you just got the text from your screen!

attention! after the run of the program, if you have an error saying "Failed to execute script", just ignore it, the program is still working just fine.
